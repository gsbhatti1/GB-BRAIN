Composite Buy and Sell Points RSI Trading Strategy

This trading strategy forms a comprehensive buying and selling point judgment mechanism by combining multiple indicators such as RSI, price change rate ROC, and moving average MA.

Specifically, it calculates the 3-period RSI, the 2-period RSI change rate, and the 100-period price change rate, and takes the average of these three as the comprehensive RSI indicator. A buy signal is generated when the composite RSI indicator line exceeds 40, and a sell signal is generated when it exceeds 70.

The advantage of this strategy is to combine the advantages of multiple indicators. RSI determines overbought and oversold, RSI change rate shows momentum, and ROC reflects the price change rate. However, each indicator has a lag, and the risk of false signals cannot be completely avoided when used in combination.

In general, this composite buying and selling point RSI strategy combines the advantages of multiple indicators and can improve the accuracy of judgment. However, when applying real trading, you still need to pay attention to risk control methods such as parameter optimization and stop loss setting to achieve long-term stable results.

This trading strategy combines RSI, rate of change ROC, and moving average MA to form an integrated mechanism for identifying entry signals.

Specifically, it calculates a 3-period RSI, 2-period RSI change rate, and 100-period price rate of change, taking the average of these 3 as the composite RSI indicator. Buy signals are generated when the composite RSI crosses above 40, and sell signals when it crosses above 70.

The advantage of this strategy is that it synergizes the strengths of multiple indicators - RSI for overbought/oversold, RSI rate of change for momentum, and ROC for price rate of change. However, each indicator has lag, and combining them cannot fully avoid the risk of false signals.

In summary, this composite entry signal RSI strategy fuses the strengths of multiple indicators to improve judgment accuracy. But for practical application, attention is still needed on risk controls like parameter optimization and stop loss settings, in order to achieve long-term stability.
