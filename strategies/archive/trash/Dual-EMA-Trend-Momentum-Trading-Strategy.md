#### Overview
This is a quantitative trading strategy based on dual EMA crossover and trend following. The strategy primarily utilizes 47-period and 95-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to capture market trends, executing trades based on EMA crossover signals. Operating on a 15-minute timeframe, it combines technical analysis and momentum trading principles to achieve consistent trading returns.

#### Strategy Principles
The core mechanism relies on identifying trend changes through crossovers between short-term EMA (47-period) and long-term EMA (95-period). Buy signals are generated when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, while positions are closed when the short-term EMA crosses below. This design is based on price momentum and trend continuation principles, using EMA crossovers to confirm trend transition points.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Clear Signals: Dual EMA crossovers provide explicit entry and exit signals, reducing uncertainty from subjective judgment.
2. Trend Following: The strategy effectively captures medium to short-term trends, generating profits during trend continuation.
3. High Automation: Simple and clear strategy logic enables easy programming implementation and backtesting.
4. Strong Adaptability: Strategy can be adapted to different market environments by adjusting EMA periods.
5. Controlled Risk: Systematic trading rules help control emotional fluctuations and maintain trading discipline.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Poor Performance in Ranging Markets: Frequent false breakouts in sideways markets may lead to consecutive losses.
2. Lag Effect: EMA indicators have inherent lag, potentially missing optimal entry points or experiencing larger drawdowns during trend reversals.
3. Parameter Dependency: Strategy performance heavily relies on EMA period selection, requiring different parameters for different markets.
4. Capital Management: Lack of comprehensive stop-loss mechanisms may result in significant losses during volatile periods.

#### Optimization Directions
1. Incorporate Volatility Indicators: Add ATR indicator for dynamic stop-loss adjustment to enhance risk control.
2. Add Trend Filters: Combine RSI or MACD indicators to screen for more reliable trading signals.
3. Optimize Parameter Selection: Implement machine learning methods for automatic selection of optimal EMA periods in different market environments.
4. Improve Capital Management: Enhance position sizing and risk control modules, set maximum loss percentage per trade.
5. Include Market Environment Analysis: Introduce market structure analysis to reduce trading frequency or pause trading during ranging markets.

#### Conclusion
This is a well-structured and logically rigorous trend-following strategy. It captures market trends through dual EMA crossovers, offering good operability and scalability. While certain limitations exist, continuous optimization and improvement can develop it into a stable and reliable trading system. The key is to flexibly adjust parameters based on different market characteristics and establish comprehensive risk control mechanisms.

strategy("EMA Crossover Strategy", overlay=true)

// Define the EMA periods
shortEmaPeriod = 47
longEmaPeriod = 95

// Calculate EMAs
ema11 = ta.ema(close, shortEmaPeriod)
ema21 = ta.ema(close, longEmaPeriod)

// Plot EMAs on the chart
plot(ema11, title="11 EMA", color=color.blue, linewidth=2)
plot(ema21, title="21 EMA", color=color.red, linewidth=2)

// Generate trading signals
longSignal = ta.crossover(ema11, ema21)
shortSignal = ta.crossunder(ema11, ema21)

// Execute trades based on signals
if (longSignal)
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)

if (shortSignal)
    strategy.close("Buy")

// Optional: Plot buy and sell signals on the chart

plotshape(series=shortSignal, location=location.abovebar, color=color.red, style=shape.labeldown, text="Sell")

// Plot buy/sell signals on the main chart
