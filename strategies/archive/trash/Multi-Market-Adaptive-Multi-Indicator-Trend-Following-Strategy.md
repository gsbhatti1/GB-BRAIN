#### Overview
This is an adaptive trend following strategy based on multiple technical indicators that automatically adjusts parameters according to different market characteristics. The strategy combines the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO), and Coppock Curve to capture market trends, with volatility adjustment factors to adapt to different market features. It includes a comprehensive position management and risk control system that dynamically adjusts trading size based on market volatility.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic of the strategy is to confirm trend direction and trading timing through multiple indicator cooperation:
1. Uses CMF indicator to measure money flow and judge market sentiment
2. Employs DPO to eliminate long-term trend influence and focus on medium-short term price fluctuations
3. Adopts modified Coppock indicator to capture trend turning points
4. Generates trading signals only when all three indicators confirm
5. Dynamically calculates stop-loss and take-profit levels using ATR
6. Automatically adjusts leverage and volatility parameters based on different market characteristics (stocks, forex, futures)

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Multiple indicator cross-validation effectively filters false signals
2. Strong adaptability suitable for different market environments
3. Comprehensive position management system with dynamic position sizing based on volatility
4. Includes stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms to control risk while protecting profits
5. Supports multiple instrument trading for risk diversification
6. Clear trading logic that's easy to maintain and optimize

#### Strategy Risks
1. Multiple indicator system may have lag in fast-moving markets
2. Parameter optimization may lead to overfitting
3. False signals may occur during market regime changes
4. Tight stop-loss settings may result in frequent stops
5. Trading costs will impact strategy returns
Risk management recommendations:
- Regular parameter validity checks
- Real-time position monitoring
- Proper leverage control
- Maximum drawdown limits

#### Optimization Directions
1. Introduce market volatility state judgment to use different parameter sets in different volatility environments
2. Add more market characteristic identification indicators to improve strategy adaptability
3. Optimize stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms, consider implementing trailing stops
4. Develop automatic parameter optimization system for periodic adjustment
5. Add trading cost analysis module
6. Implement risk warning mechanism

#### Summary
This strategy is a comprehensive trend following system that balances returns and risk through multiple indicators and risk control mechanisms. The strategy has strong extensibility with significant room for optimization. It is recommended to start with small scale in live trading, gradually increase trading size, while continuously monitoring strategy performance and adjusting parameters.
