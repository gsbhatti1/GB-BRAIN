#### Overview
This strategy combines RSI overbought/oversold signals with Bollinger Bands boundaries to create a trading system that manages risk through dynamic stop-loss levels and reward-to-risk ratio-based take-profit levels. The core mechanism triggers trading signals when RSI crosses overbought/oversold levels, enhanced by price position within Bollinger Bands.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy operates on several key principles:
1. Uses 14-period RSI to measure market overbought/oversold conditions
2. Generates long signals when RSI crosses above 30 (oversold)
3. Generates short signals when RSI crosses below 70 (overbought)
4. Sets long stop-loss based on 10-period low
5. Sets short stop-loss based on 10-period high
6. Calculates take-profit levels using a 2:1 risk-to-reward ratio
7. Confirms trade signals using Bollinger Bands position

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dynamic Risk Management: Strategy adapts to market volatility through dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels.
2. Clear Risk-Reward Ratio: Fixed 2:1 ratio promotes consistent long-term profitability.
3. Multiple Signal Confirmation: Combines RSI and Bollinger Bands for improved signal reliability.
4. Automated Execution: Eliminates emotional bias through complete automation.
5. Flexible Parameters: Adjustable RSI and risk management parameters for different market characteristics.

#### Strategy Risks
1. False Breakout Risk: RSI crossover signals may generate false breakouts.
2. Range Market Risk: Frequent stop-loss triggers may occur in sideways markets.
3. Stop-Loss Setting Risk: Fixed-period high/low stops may not suit all market conditions.
4. Money Management Risk: Fixed risk-reward ratio may be too aggressive in certain markets.
5. Slippage Risk: Significant price deviation may occur during high volatility periods.

#### Optimization Directions
1. Trend Filter Integration: Add moving averages for trend-aligned trading.
2. Stop-Loss Optimization: Consider ATR for dynamic stop-loss adjustment.
3. Volume Confirmation: Include volume indicators for signal validation.
4. Market Environment Classification: Adjust risk-reward ratio based on market conditions.
5. Time Filtering: Avoid trading during low volatility periods.
6. Parameter Adaptation: Implement adaptive mechanisms for RSI parameters.

#### Summary
This strategy creates a comprehensive trading system by combining RSI overbought/oversold signals with Bollinger Bands boundaries. Its core strengths lie in dynamic risk management and clear risk-reward ratio settings, though attention must be paid to false breakout risks and changing market conditions. Further improvements can be achieved through trend filtering, stop-loss optimization, and other suggested enhancements.
