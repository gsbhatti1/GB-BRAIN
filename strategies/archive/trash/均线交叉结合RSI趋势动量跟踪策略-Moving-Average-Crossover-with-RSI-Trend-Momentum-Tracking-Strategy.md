#### Overview
This is a trend-following strategy that combines moving average crossovers with the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The strategy determines market trend direction through short-term and long-term moving average crossovers, while using RSI as a momentum filter to confirm trend strength, thereby improving the reliability of trading signals. The strategy also incorporates percentage-based stop-loss and take-profit for risk management.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy employs 9-period and 21-period Simple Moving Averages (SMA) as primary trend indicators. Long signals are generated when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA and RSI is above 50, while short signals occur when the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA and RSI is below 50. This design ensures trade direction aligns with both market trend and momentum. The system controls risk-reward ratio through 1% stop-loss and 2% take-profit levels.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dual confirmation mechanism combining MA and RSI improves signal reliability.
2. Percentage-based stop-loss and take-profit provides flexible and adaptive risk management.
3. High parameter adaptability suitable for different market environments and instruments.
4. Simple and clear strategy logic, easy to understand and maintain.
5. RSI filtering reduces losses from false breakouts.

#### Strategy Risks
1. May generate frequent false signals in ranging markets.
2. Fixed percentage stops may not be flexible enough in highly volatile markets.
3. Moving average systems have inherent lag, potentially missing optimal entry points.
4. RSI indicator may become ineffective in extreme market conditions.
5. Requires careful parameter optimization for different market environments.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce adaptive stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms that adjust dynamically with market volatility.
2. Add volume indicators as additional confirmation signals.
3. Optimize moving average periods, consider using Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for increased sensitivity.
4. Implement trend strength filters to reduce position size or pause trading during sideways markets.
5. Add time filters to avoid trading during market opening and closing periods.

#### Summary
This is a well-structured trend-following strategy with clear logic. It provides basic trend direction through MA crossovers, momentum confirmation through RSI, combined with risk management mechanisms to form a complete trading system. While it has some inherent limitations, through continuous optimization and adjustment, the strategy has the potential to maintain stable performance across different market environments. The key to success lies in parameter optimization and risk control execution.
