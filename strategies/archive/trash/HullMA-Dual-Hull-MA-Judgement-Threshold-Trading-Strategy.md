> Strategy Description

[trans]

This strategy uses a combination of double Hull moving averages and daily K-line comparisons to set the judgment threshold for long and short conditions. Stop-loss and take-profit prices are also set for risk management.

Strategy principle:

1. Calculate the Double Hull Moving Average and compare the current value with the size of the previous period.
2. Calculate the daily K-line closing price change rate and set the long and short decision threshold.
3. Go long when the fast line crosses the slow line and the daily rate of change exceeds the threshold. When the fast line crosses the slow line and the daily rate of change is lower than the threshold, go short.
4. Set a fixed stop loss and take profit price. Positions will be closed automatically when the price hits stop loss and take profit.
5. You can also set the maximum opening quantity.

Advantages of this strategy:

1. Double HullMA can improve the accuracy of judgment. The daily K-line change rate confirms the leading direction.
2. Threshold setting to avoid being affected by small reverse prices.
3. Stop loss and stop profit can help lock in profits and control risks.

Risks of this strategy:

1. Setting the threshold too high or too low will miss trading opportunities. Test with caution.
2. The fixed stop-loss and take-profit prices cannot be adjusted flexibly, and there is a risk of unreasonable setting.
3. Both HullMA and daily rate of change have lag problems.

In short, this strategy trades through dual indicator judgments and risk management measures, which can improve stability to a certain extent. However, we still need to pay attention to parameter optimization issues and find the best configuration.

This strategy trades based on a combination of dual Hull Moving Averages and daily candle comparison, with judgment thresholds for long/short conditions. It also uses fixed stop loss/take profit for risk management.

Strategy Logic:

1. Calculate dual Hull MAs and compare current value versus previous period.
2. Compute daily close change rate, and set long/short judgment thresholds.
3. Go long when fast MA crosses above slow MA, and daily change exceeds threshold. Vice versa for short.
4. Use fixed stop loss and take profit prices. Close positions when hit.
5. Can also set maximum open position limit.

Advantages:

1. Dual HullMA improves accuracy. Daily change confirms bias.
2. Thresholds avoid being swayed by small counter-trend moves.
3. SL/TP helps lock in profits and control risks.

Risks:

1. Bad threshold settings can miss opportunities. Prudent testing needed.
2. Fixed SL/TP Unable to flexibly adjust, risks improper settings.
3. Both Hull MA and daily change lag.

In summary, this dual-indicator judgment system with risk controls can improve stability to some extent. But optimization is still required to find the ideal configurations.
