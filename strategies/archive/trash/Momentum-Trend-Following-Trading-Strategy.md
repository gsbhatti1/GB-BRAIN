This Pine Script defines the trading strategy with the specified parameters and conditions for entering buy and sell trades. The `buyCondition` is triggered when both the fast EMA crosses above the slow EMA, the price closes above the short-term EMA, and RSI is above 55. The `sellCondition` triggers a short position when the opposite occurs with the RSI below 45. Additionally, entry points are further filtered by demand and supply zones to ensure more precise trades.
