Strategy Description

[trans]

This strategy is designed based on Mr. Kase's dynamic stop loss theory. This strategy calculates the dynamic range of price fluctuations and finds the best stop-loss and take-profit price points to achieve breakeven.

Strategy principle:

1. Calculate the dynamic range index RWH and RWL of the price.
2. Obtain the price deviation index Pk based on RWH and RWL.
3. When Pk>0, the stop loss price is calculated based on the degree of deviation. When Pk<0, calculate the take profit price.
4. You can choose the deviation multiple of stop loss and take profit, which is generally 1-3 times the standard deviation.
5. When the price touches the stop-loss and take-profit price, perform reverse operation.

Advantages of this strategy:

1. Dynamically calculate stop-loss and stop-profit points, which can be adjusted according to market fluctuations.
2. The stop loss point will not be too close or too loose.
3. Mathematical calculation methods can prevent subjective emotions from affecting judgment.

Risks of this strategy:

1. There is a lag in calculating the stop loss price, and the best stop loss time may be missed.
2. The deviation multiple parameter needs to be optimized to balance stop loss and profit.
3. There is no way to limit the size of a single loss, and there is a risk of large loss.

In summary, this strategy can intelligently optimize stop-loss and take-profit settings to some extent but still requires thorough backtesting. It also cannot fully eliminate subjective risks so prudent trading remains essential.

This strategy is based on Mr. Kase's dynamic stop loss approach, computing price's dynamic range to find optimal stop loss and take profit levels for balancing profits and losses.

Strategy Logic:

1. Calculate price's dynamic range indices RWH and RWL.
2. Derive deviation level index Pk from RWH and RWL.
3. When Pk>0, compute stop loss based on deviation level. When Pk<0, compute take profit.
4. Deviation multiples generally range from 1-3 standard deviations.
5. Take opposing position when price hits stop loss/profit.

Advantages:

1. Dynamic stops/profits adapt to changing volatility.
2. Stops are neither too tight nor too loose.
3. Mathematical approach avoids emotional and subjective judgments.

Risks:

1. Stop calculations lag, potentially missing best stop timing.
2. Parameter tuning needed to balance stops and targets.
3. No limit on loss size, risks large losing trades.

In summary, this approach can intelligently optimize stops and targets to some extent but still requires robust backtesting. It also cannot fully eliminate subjective risks so prudent trading remains essential.

// The Kase Dev Stops system finds the optimal statistical balance between letting profits run,
// while cutting losses. Kase DevStop seeks an ideal stop level by accounting for volatility (risk),
// the variance in volatility (the change in volatility from bar to bar), and volatility skew
// (the propensity for volatility to occasionally spike incorrectly).
//
// Kase Dev Stops are set at points at which there is an increasing probability of reversal against
// the trend being statistically significant based on the log normal shape of the range curve.
// Setting stops will help you take as much risk as necessary to stay in a good position, but not more.
