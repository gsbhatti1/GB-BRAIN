## Strategy Principle

This strategy combines the MACD indicator and the moving average indicator, performing long transactions when they give signals in the same direction.

The specific transaction logic is:

1. Calculate the FAST MACD value, generally taking the 12-day exponential moving average.
2. Calculate the SLOW MACD value, generally taking the 26-day exponential moving average.
3. The MACD value is FAST minus SLOW.
4. Calculate the signal line of MACD, generally taking the 9-day moving average.
5. Calculate the 9-day and 26-day moving averages.
6. When MACD crosses the signal line, consider going long.
7. When the 9-day moving average crosses the 26-day moving average, go long.
8. When MACD goes below the signal line and the 9-day moving average goes below the 26-day moving average, close the position.

This strategy makes full use of MACD's overbought and oversold judgment and the trend tracking ability of the moving average, combining the two for trading to increase the success rate.

## Strategic Advantages

- MACD determines overbought and oversold conditions, while the moving average identifies trends.
- The combination provides high-probability long opportunities.
- Clear rules are easy to implement.

## Strategy Risk

- Requires repeated testing to determine the best parameters.
- Limited to going long, unable to take advantage of short opportunities.
- With-trend trading may increase losses.

## Summary

This strategy maximizes the strengths of both MACD and moving average indicators by combining them to determine market rhythms. However, attention should be paid to long-only limitations and parameter optimization.

## Strategy Logic

This strategy combines the MACD indicator with moving averages, going long when both give aligned signals.

The logic is:

1. Compute FAST MACD, typically 12-day EMA.
2. Compute SLOW MACD, typically 26-day EMA.
3. MACD is FAST minus SLOW.
4. Signal line is typically 9-day MA of MACD.
5. Compute 9-day and 26-day MAs.
6. Consider long when MACD crosses above signal line.
7. Go long when 9-day MA crosses above 26-day MA.
8. Close long when MACD crosses below signal line and 9-day MA crosses below 26-day MA.

The strategy leverages MACD’s overbought-oversold gauge and MA’s trend following ability, combining both for higher odds trades.

## Advantages

- MACD judges overbought/oversold conditions; moving average determines trends.
- Combination provides high-probability long opportunities.
- Clear rules are easy to implement.

## Risks

- Requires optimization to determine best parameters.
- Limited to going long and unable to use short opportunities.
- With-trend trades may magnify losses.

## Summary

This strategy utilizes the strengths of MACD and moving averages in judging market rhythms. However, limitations such as long-only trading and parameter optimization warrant caution.
