// THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN BUILT TO BE USED AS A S&P500 SPY CRASH INDICATOR (should not be used as a strategy).
// THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN BUILT AS A STRATEGY FOR VISUALIZATION PURPOSES ONLY AND HAS NOT BEEN OPTIMISED FOR PROFIT.
// The script has been built to show as a lower indicator and also gives visual SELL signal on top when conditions are met. BARE IN MIND NO STOP LOSS, NOR ADVANCED EXIT STRATEGY HAS BEEN BUILT.
// As well as the chart SELL signal an alert has also been built into this script.
// The script utilizes a VIX indicator (marron line) and 50 period Momentum (blue line) and Danger/No trade zone(pink shading).
// When the Momentum line crosses down across the VIX this is a sell off but in order to only signal major sell offs the SELL signal only triggers if the momentum continues down through the danger zone.
// To use this indicator to identify ideal buying then you should only buy when Momentum line is crossed above the VIX and the Momentum line is above the Danger Zone. 
// This is best used as a daily time frame indicator
