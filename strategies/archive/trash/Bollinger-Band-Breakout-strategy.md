> Strategy Description

[trans]

This strategy trades based on Bollinger Bands breakout signals. Bollinger Bands consist of the middle track, upper track, and lower track. The middle track is an n-period moving average, and the Bollinger Bands calculate the standard deviation based on the middle track to obtain the upper and lower tracks. The upper rail is equal to the middle rail plus the standard deviation, and the lower rail is equal to the middle rail minus the standard deviation. When the price breaks through the upper rail from the lower rail upwards, it means that the current trend is strongly upward, then go long; when the price falls from the upper rail downwards and breaks through the lower rail, it means that the current trend is strongly downward, then go short. The parameters for this strategy to construct Bollinger Bands include: mid-track period n and standard deviation multiple m. A typical parameter combination is 20 periods and 1.5 times the standard deviation. The settings of parameters n and m directly affect the width of Bollinger Bands, thereby affecting the frequency of breakout signals. Period n can be set between 10 and 20, and the standard deviation multiple m can be set between 1 and 2 times. Generally, more conservative parameter settings mean fewer but more reliable breakout signals.

The advantage of this strategy is to use Bollinger Bands to determine market trends and volatility, determine the timing of entry based on breakout signals, and retreat to exit. However, this strategy also has problems such as Bollinger Band lag, unreliable breakout signals, and no stop loss settings. Generally speaking, this strategy is more suitable for markets with obvious trends, but it needs to be used with caution. The stability of the strategy can be improved through parameter optimization, stop loss, and indicator filtering.

To sum up, although the Bollinger Bands breakout strategy has certain advantages, it also carries many risks. Only when parameter optimization and risk control are in place can this strategy be stably applied to real trading.

||Strategy Principles

This strategy trades based on Bollinger Band breakouts. The Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band, upper band, and lower band. The middle band is an n-period moving average, while the upper and lower bands are calculated by adding/subtracting x standard deviations from the middle band. A breakout above the upper band indicates an uptrend, while a breakout below the lower band signals a downtrend. Typical values are 20 periods and 1.5x standard deviations. The settings of n and m directly affect the width of the bands, and therefore the frequency of breakout signals. Period n can be set between 10-20, while the standard deviation multiplier m can be set between 1-2x. More conservative parameter settings generally mean fewer but more reliable breakout signals.

The advantage of this strategy is using Bollinger Bands to determine market trends and volatility, and entering based on breakout signals and exiting on pullbacks. However, issues like band lagging, unreliable breakout signals, and lack of stop loss exist. Overall, this strategy works better in markets with clear trends, but should be used cautiously. Optimization of parameters, adding stops, and signal filters can improve the stability of the strategy.

In summary, while the Bollinger Band breakout strategy has some merits, it also carries significant risks. Only with proper optimization, risk control, and money management can this strategy be applied in live trading in a stable manner.
