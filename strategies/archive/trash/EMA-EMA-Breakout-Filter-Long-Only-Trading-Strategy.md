Strategy Description

This strategy only performs long operations, uses ATR to build channels, filters out false breakout signals from the EMA moving average, and pursues stable long transactions. This strategy belongs to the trend following type of strategy.

Strategy principle:

1. Calculate the n-period EMA moving average, which represents the mid- to long-term trend.
2. Calculate n-period ATR and construct the upper and lower rails of the range channel.
3. When the price breaks through the upper rail of the channel from bottom to top, perform a long operation.
4. When the price breaks through the lower rail of the channel from top to bottom, close the long position.
5. The ATR channel setting can effectively filter small or short-term false breakthroughs.

Advantages of this strategy:

1. Using ATR channel judgment can improve the reliability of long signals.
2. Only doing long can reduce the difficulty of judgment and reduce risks.
3. Parameter optimization is simple and can easily cope with different market types.

Risks of this strategy:

1. Only going long cannot obtain the excess returns of the short market.
2. Both EMA and ATR have lag problems, and the entry time is not good.
3. It is difficult to obtain sustained long signals in long-term volatile markets.

In summary, as a simple trend following strategy, this strategy can achieve better results in the bull market, but you need to be wary of lagging and continued shocks.

This long-only strategy uses an ATR channel to filter fake EMA breakouts for stable trend-following long trades. It solely focuses on long side trading.

Strategy Logic:

1. Calculate n-period EMA as intermediate-term trend.
2. Calculate n-period ATR for range channel bands.
3. Go long when price breaks above channel top.
4. Exit long when price breaks below channel bottom.
5. ATR channel filters insignificant or short-term false breakouts.

Advantages:

1. ATR channel improves reliability of long signals.
2. Long only reduces complexity and risks.
3. Simple optimization adapts easily across markets.

Risks:

1. Unable to profit from short-side moves.
2. Both EMA and ATR lag, causing poor entry timing.
3. Hard to sustain signals in prolonged ranges.

In summary, this simple system can perform well in bull trends but requires caution on lagging indicators and ranging markets.
