[trans]

This article will introduce in detail a quantitative trading strategy that uses dynamic support and resistance for trend following. This strategy calculates the moving average and ATR to form the upper and lower rails for trend tracking.

1. Strategy Principles

The strategy mainly includes the following indicators and logic:

1. Calculate the highest price moving average within a certain period as the upper track;
2. Use ATR to calculate the distance of stops future losses as a buffer;
3. Subtract the buffer distance from the upper rail to get the lower rail;
4. Go long when the price goes above the upper track; close the position when it goes below the lower track.

In this way, the upper and lower rails build a dynamic support and resistance band. By breaking through the upper track to chase the rise and fall, and by quickly stopping the loss through the lower track, you can control trading risks.

2. Strategic Advantages

This strategy mainly has the following advantages:

1. Dynamic tracks can capture trend opportunities;
2. ATR stop loss method can set stop loss according to market volatility;
3. The trailing stop profit is greater than the stop loss range, which is beneficial to profits;
4. The rules are simple, direct and easy to implement.

3. Potential Risks

But there are some potential problems with this strategy:

1. The moving average and ATR indicators lag behind, and opportunities may be missed;
2. Need to withstand greater retracement pressure;
3. There is no limit on the number of entries;
4. Parameters need to be optimized to adapt to different varieties.

4. Content Summary

This article details a trend following strategy that uses moving averages and ATR to establish a dynamic track. It can set stop-loss and stop-profit according to market volatility and capture the trend. But we also need to pay attention to issues such as indicator lag and retracement control. Overall, it provides a simple method of trend following.

This article explains in detail a trend following strategy that utilizes dynamic support and resistance levels. It forms upper and lower bands using moving averages and ATR to track trends.

I. Strategy Logic

The main indicators and logic include:

1. Calculating highest high moving average over a period as the upper band.
2. Using ATR to compute buffer distance for stop loss.
3. Upper band minus buffer sets the lower band.
4. Take long when price breaks above upper band; exit when price breaks below lower band.

The upper and lower bands construct dynamic support and resistance zones. By trend riding breakouts and quick stops, trading risks can be controlled.

II. Advantages of the Strategy

The main advantages are:

1. Dynamic bands can capture trend opportunities.
2. ATR stop loss sets stops based on market volatility.
3. Larger profit target than stop loss benefits profits.
4. Simple rules make it easy to implement.

III. Potential Risks

However, some potential issues exist:

1. Moving averages and ATR have lagging issues.
2. Larger drawdowns need to be endured.
3. No limit on number of entries.
4. Parameters need optimization for different products.

IV. Summary

In summary, this article has explained a trend following strategy using moving averages and ATR to form dynamic bands. It can set stop loss and take profit based on volatility to ride trends. But risks like indicator lag and drawdown control need attention. Overall it provides a simple trend tracking method.
