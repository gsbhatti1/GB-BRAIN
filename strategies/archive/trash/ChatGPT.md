ChatGPT handles new announcements on exchanges

Strategy Description

An effective way to solve the problem of inconsistent listing time on exchanges is to use ChatGPT for processing and avoid using regular expressions for cumbersome matching. Handing announcements directly to ChatGPT, allowing it to identify and process the time formats of various exchanges, has become a convenient and efficient application scenario.

By passing the announcement text to the openaiCompletions function, you can leverage the power of ChatGPT to extract key information from listing announcements on various exchanges. This approach not only improves processing efficiency but also enhances compatibility with different time formats.

Before using this function, you need to set the policy parameter OPENAI_API_KEY, which provides your OpenAI API key. You can use your own key to access the gpt-3.5-turbo API.

Function name: openaiCompletions

Function introduction: This function determines whether the input announcement content is an announcement of a new trading pair on the exchange's spot by calling OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model. If the announcement meets the conditions, the function will return a JSON object, including the success ID, trading pair, and Beijing time; if the announcement does not meet the conditions, only a failure ID will be returned.

Input parameters:
content: Announcement content that needs to be judged.

Output result:
JSON object containing the following key-value pairs:

success: Boolean value, indicating whether the judgment result is successful.
pair: (only present when success is true) Array of strings representing trading pairs.
time: (only exists when success is true) A string indicating the announcement release time, which has been converted to Beijing time (UTC+8).
Function execution flow:

Define the URL, request headers and request data for requesting gpt-3.5-turbo API.
Call the HttpQuery method to send the request data to the gpt-3.5-turbo API in JSON format.
Parse the JSON data returned by the gpt-3.5-turbo API and extract the required information.
Returns the processed JSON object.

Usage example:

```javascript
var content = "An exchange announced that it will launch the ID/USDT trading pair at 12:00 on March 22, 2023 (UTC+8).";
var result = openaiCompletions(content);
Log(result);
```

Output result:

```json
{
"success": true,
"pair": ["ID_USDT"],
"time": "2023-03-22 12:00:00"
}
```
