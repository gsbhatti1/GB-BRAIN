EMA Slope and Cross Trend Trading Strategy (by ChartArt)

> Strategy Description

---

## Overview

This strategy uses the slope direction and cross relationships among multiple EMAs to determine trend direction, enabling non-stop trend trading. It can always hold long or short positions.

## Strategy Logic

1. Calculate 3 groups of EMAs—fast, medium, and slow EMAs.
2. When the fast EMA crosses above the medium EMA, and the medium EMA slope turns positive, a long signal is generated.
3. When the fast EMA crosses below the medium EMA, and the medium EMA slope turns negative, a short signal is generated.
4. Go long when price crosses above the slow EMA, and go short when price crosses below the slow EMA.
5. The EMA slope relationships reflect trend changes, with price crossovers confirming entry.

## Advantage Analysis

1. Multiple EMAs improve accuracy in trend judgment.
2. Fast, medium, and slow EMAs reasonably distinguish between trends and consolidations.
3. EMA slope changes provide early hints on trend changes.
4. Price crossovers further confirm to avoid false breakouts.
5. Always holding a position fully captures trend opportunities.

## Risk Analysis

1. Sole reliance on EMAs carries large position risks during range-bound periods.
2. Improper EMA parameters may miss turning points.
3. Unable to determine trend strength, risking premature reverse entries.
4. No effective single trade loss control mechanism.

## Improvement Directions

1. Test different EMA combinations to find optimal parameters.
2. Add other indicators like MACD to determine strength.
3. Add stop loss mechanisms for risk control.
4. Evaluate trend strength to avoid premature reverse entries.
5. Optimize position sizing for capital management.
6. Temporarily stop trading when the trend becomes choppy.

## Summary

The strategy sensibly uses EMA combos to determine trends, with a reasonable framework. However, sole reliance on EMAs has limitations, leaving large optimization space to incorporate more indicators. Risk control mechanisms are also needed to improve stability. Overall, the design is scientifically sound and has potential for growth into a strong trend trading strategy through continuous improvements.

// ChartArt's EMA Slope + EMA Cross Strategy
//
// Version 1.0
// Idea by ChartArt on March 10, 2018.
//
// This strategy uses divergences between three moving averages and their slope directions as well as crosses between the price and the moving averages to switch between long/short positions.
//
// The strategy is non-stop in the market and always either long or short. 
// Additionally, the moving averages are colored depending on whether they are trending up or down.
//
// List of my work: 
// https://www.tradingview.com/u/ChartArt/

// Input
price = input(close)
MA1_Length = input(2, step=1, title="EMA 1 Length")
MA2_Length = input(4, step=1, title="EMA 2 Length")
MA3_Length = input(20, step=1, title="EMA 3 Length")

switch1=input(true, title="Show Bar Color?")
switch2=input(true, title="Show Moving Averages?")

// Calculation
MA1 = ema(price, MA1_Length)
MA2 = ema(price, MA2_Length)
MA3 = ema(price, MA3_Length)

// Strategy
long = crossunder(price, MA3) or ( change(price)<0 and change(MA1)<0 and crossunder(price,MA1) and change(MA2)>0 )
short = crossover(price, MA3) or ( change(price)>0 and change(MA1)>0 and crossover(price,MA1)  and change(MA2)<0 ) 

if long
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, comment="Long")

if short
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, comment="Short")

// Strategy Alert
alertcondition(long, title='EMA Slope + EMA Cross Strategy, Long Alert', message='Go Long!')
alertcondition(short, title='EMA Slope + EMA Cross Strategy, Short Alert', message='Go Short!')

// MA trend bar color
up =  change(MA2)>0 and change(MA3)>0
dn =  change(MA2)<0 and change(MA3)<0
bar_color = up?green:dn?red:blue
barcolor(switch1?bar_color:na)

// MA trend output color
MA2_color = change(MA2)>0?lime:change(MA2)<0?red:blue
MA3_color = change(MA3)>0?lime:change(MA3)<0?red:blue

// MA output
EMA2 = plot(switch2?MA2:na, title="EMA 2", style=linebr, linewidth=2, color=MA2_color)
EMA3 = plot(switch2?MA3:na, title="EMA 3", style=linebr, linewidth=4, color=MA3_color)
fill(EMA2, EMA3, color=silver, transp=50)
