#### Overview
This is a trend following strategy that combines Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Madrid Ribbon, and Donchian Channel. The strategy's uniqueness lies in its three switchable take-profit/stop-loss modes: tick-based, dollar-based, and risk-reward ratio based. It enhances reliability through a double confirmation mechanism, only executing trades on the second valid signal.

#### Strategy Principles
The strategy employs a triple technical indicator combination to identify trading opportunities:
1. 200-period EMA to determine overall trend direction
2. Madrid Ribbon (crossover of 5-period and 100-period EMA) for medium-term trend judgment
3. Donchian Channel breakout for specific entry timing

Long trade conditions: price above 200 EMA, bullish Madrid Ribbon, and price breaks above Donchian Channel.
Short trade conditions: price below 200 EMA, bearish Madrid Ribbon, and price breaks below Donchian Channel.
To reduce false signals, trades are only executed on the second valid signal occurrence.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Flexible TP/SL management system adaptable to different trading styles
2. Multiple technical indicators combination provides more reliable signals
3. Double confirmation mechanism effectively reduces false signals
4. Strategy completely avoids look-ahead bias with no repainting
5. Highly customizable for different market environments

#### Strategy Risks
1. Potential significant drawdowns during trend reversals
Solution: Adjust indicator parameters to increase strategy sensitivity
2. Over-reliance on technical indicators may miss certain market opportunities
Solution: Recommend combining with fundamental analysis
3. Fixed TP/SL may not suit all market conditions
Solution: Dynamically adjust TP/SL levels based on volatility

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce volatility indicators for dynamic TP/SL adjustment
2. Add volume analysis to improve signal reliability
3. Incorporate more market sentiment indicators
4. Develop adaptive parameter optimization system
5. Add risk management module, such as maximum drawdown control

#### Summary
This is a trend following strategy that combines multiple classic technical indicators, enhancing trading stability through flexible TP/SL management and double confirmation mechanism. The strategy's high customizability allows it to adapt to different market environments and trading styles. It is recommended to conduct thorough historical data backtesting before live trading and adjust parameters according to specific market characteristics.
