#### Overview
This strategy is a trend following system based on dual Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossovers, combined with a staged position exit mechanism to optimize trading returns. The strategy utilizes 9-period and 21-period EMAs as fast and slow lines, identifying market trend changes through their crossovers while implementing a two-stage position exit plan to balance risk and reward.

#### Strategy Principles
The core logic is based on crossover signals between the fast EMA (9-period) and slow EMA (21-period). When the fast line crosses above the slow line, the system opens a long position with 0.02 lots; when the fast line crosses below the slow line, it opens a short position with 0.02 lots. During position holding, the strategy employs a two-stage exit mechanism: the first stage closes half the position (0.01 lots) when profit reaches 200 points; the second stage closes the remaining position when a reverse crossover signal appears. This staged exit design aims to lock in partial profits while maintaining exposure to trend continuation.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Strong trend capture capability: Using two EMAs with different periods effectively identifies market trend turning points.
2. Comprehensive risk management: The staged exit mechanism locks in partial profits while maintaining exposure to trend continuation.
3. Well-validated parameters: The 9 and 21-period EMA combination has been widely tested in markets and proves reliable.
4. Clear execution logic: The entry and exit rules are explicit, facilitating live trading and backtesting.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Choppy market risk: In ranging markets, frequent crossover signals may lead to consecutive false breakout losses.
2. Slippage impact: In rapidly moving markets, staged exit execution may be affected by slippage.
3. Trend reversal risk: If market trends suddenly reverse, the strategy might close half the position at peaks, leaving remaining positions exposed to significant drawdowns.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Introduce trend filters: Add longer-period moving averages or trend indicators to filter false signals.
2. Dynamic stop-loss settings: Adjust stop-loss positions based on market volatility for more flexible risk control.
3. Optimize staged exit ratios: Adjust first exit position size and profit targets based on different market conditions.
4. Add time filters: Implement trading time windows to avoid low liquidity periods.

#### Summary
This is a complete trading system that combines classic moving average crossover strategy with modern position management. The strategy enhances the profitability of traditional moving average crossover strategies through staged exit mechanisms, but traders still need to make appropriate adjustments based on specific market conditions and their risk tolerance. Future optimization directions mainly focus on signal filtering and dynamic risk management.
