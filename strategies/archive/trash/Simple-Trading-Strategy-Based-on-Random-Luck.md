[trans]
The name of this strategy is "Simple Trading Strategy Based on Random Luck". This strategy uses a random method to generate long or short signals on the first day of each week, and evaluates the effect of random trading through a large number of repeated tests.

Specifically, the trading logic of the strategy is very simple and straightforward:

1. Toss a coin every Monday and the result will be heads or tails randomly.

2. If it is the head, go long on the day; if it is the tail, go short on the day.

3. When going long, set the stop loss to 1 times ATR and the take profit to 1 times ATR; the same goes for short selling, achieving a risk-reward ratio of 1:1.

4. Hold the position until the end of the week and close it.

The advantage of this strategy is that it backtests a large number of years of data and can evaluate the average winning rate of random trades. The trading rules are extremely simple and can be used as a baseline for strategy comparison.

However, random trading cannot take advantage of market rules and it is difficult to continuously obtain positive returns. Fixed stop-profit and stop-loss can also easily cause losses to expand. Traders can only use it as an experimental strategy and cannot be used for real trading.

Generally speaking, data backtesting can indicate the effect of random trading, but it does not represent an actual strategy that can be used. Traders ultimately need judgment and systematic trading skills.

This strategy is named "Simple Trading Strategy Based on Random Luck". It uses random methods to generate long or short signals on the first trading day of each week, evaluating the performance of random trading through large amount of repetitive testing.

Specifically, the trading logic is very straightforward:

1. Flip a coin on every Monday, randomly generating heads or tails results.

2. If heads, go long that day. If tails, go short that day.

3. Set stop loss at 1 x ATR and take profit at 1 x ATR when long, vice versa when short, achieving 1:1 risk-reward ratio.

4. Hold position until end of the week then close.

The advantage is backtesting many years of data to evaluate average win rate of random trading. The trading rules are extremely simple and can serve as a benchmark baseline for comparison.

But random trading cannot utilize market patterns and will unlikely generate sustained gains. Fixed stop loss and take profit also risk enlarging losses. Traders can only use it as an experimental strategy, not for live trading.

In conclusion, backtest results may suggest outcomes of random trading, but do not represent actually applicable strategies. Traders ultimately still need discretion and systematic trading techniques.
