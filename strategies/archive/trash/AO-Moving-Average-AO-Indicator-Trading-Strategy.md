> Strategy Description

[trans]

This strategy uses a combination of the moving average system and the AO swing indicator to identify the trend direction and conduct trend trading. This strategy belongs to the short-term shock trading type and is designed to capture short-term price reversal opportunities.

Strategy principle:

1. Calculate fast EMA and slow SMA to build an moving average system.
2. Calculate the fast line and slow line of the AO swing indicator and get the difference.
3. When the fast line crosses the slow line, the closing price is higher than the slow line, and AO is rising, go long.
4. When the fast line crosses the slow line, the closing price is lower than the slow line, and AO is in a downward state, go short.
5. AO determines the long and short status through difference comparison to avoid false signals.

Advantages of this strategy:

1. The moving average system determines the main trend, and the AO indicator identifies the reversal point.
2. AO can effectively filter false signals through difference comparison.
3. Using indicators in combination can improve signal accuracy.

Risks of this strategy:

1. The moving average and AO parameters need to be optimized to match the market conditions.
2. Both the moving average and AO have lagging issues and may miss the best entry point.
3. It is difficult to set a stop loss in a volatile market, and the risk of loss is high.

In short, this strategy combines the advantages of the moving average system and the AO indicator for trading. The signal quality can be improved to a certain extent, but you need to be wary of lagging issues and adopt appropriate stop-loss strategies to obtain long-term stable returns.

This strategy combines moving averages and the AO oscillator to identify trends and trade pullbacks. It aims to capture short-term reversals in price oscillation.

Strategy Logic:

1. Calculate fast EMA and slow SMA to construct a moving average system.
2. Calculate fast and slow AO lines and the difference between them.
3. Go long when fast MA crosses above slow MA, close is above slow MA, and AO rises.
4. Go short when fast MA crosses below slow MA, close is below slow MA, and AO falls.
5. AO compares differences to avoid false signals.

Advantages:

1. MAs determine main trend, AO times reversals.
2. AO difference filters false signals.
3. Combining indicators improves accuracy.

Risks:

1. Tuning required to match MA and AO with market conditions.
2. Both MAs and AO lag, potentially missing best entries.
3. Hard to set stops in ranging markets, increasing loss risks.

In summary, this strategy combines the strengths of MAs and AO for trading. This can improve signal quality to some extent but proper stops are still required to manage risks for steady returns.
