> Strategy Description

[trans]

This strategy trades based on the continuous rising or falling breakthroughs of the K-line. This strategy determines whether the recent K-line trend shows a sustained upward or downward trend to capture short-term trend opportunities.

Strategy principle:

1. Compare the current K line with the K line before a fixed period, such as 5 periods ago.
2. When the closing price of multiple consecutive K-lines rises from the opening price, enter the market long.
3. When the closing price of multiple consecutive K-lines drops from the opening price, enter the market short.
4. Set a stop loss line to avoid losses from expanding.
5. You can customize the historical backtest cycle and optimize parameters.

Advantages of this strategy:

1. Continuous rises and falls can determine short-term trends.
2. Message reminders can be added during real offer for easy monitoring.
3. The optimization of backtest parameters is simple and easy to implement.

Risks of this strategy:

1. It is impossible to judge the overall mid- and long-term trend, and there is a risk of being trapped.
2. The stop loss point is close, which may lead to excessive stop loss.
3. Be wary of reversal risks and take the initiative to stop losses when appropriate.

In short, this strategy conducts short-term trading by judging the K-line trend breakthrough, and can obtain good backtesting results after optimizing the parameters. However, it is still necessary to be wary of reversal risks and stop losses in a timely manner during actual trading.

This strategy trades consecutive upside or downside bar breakouts, judging if recent price action exhibits persistence in one direction. It aims to capture short-term trend opportunities.

Strategy Logic:

1. Check if current bar is up/down versus bars from fixed lookback, e.g., 5 bars ago.
2. Enter long after multiple bars close higher than open.
3. Enter short after multiple bars close lower than open.
4. Use stops to limit loss.
5. Customizable backtest period for optimizing parameters.

Advantages:

1. Consecutive up/down bars determine short-term trends.
2. Real-time alerts possible for monitoring.
3. Simple backtest optimization enables live trading.

Risks:

1. No overall mid/long-term bias, risks whipsaws.
2. Tight stops may exit prematurely.
3. Beware of reversals, prudent to actively take profits.

In summary, this short-term tactical strategy has potential based on backtests, but requires caution on reversals and disciplined loss cutting when live trading.
