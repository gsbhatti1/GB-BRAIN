Strategy Description

Bull surround K line reversal strategy

This strategy performs long reversal trades by identifying the "long siege" K-line pattern. Specifically, a buy signal is generated when the following conditions are met:

1. The current K-line entity is small and completely surrounded by the previous large negative line.
2. The color of the current K-line entity is opposite to that of the previous K-line.
3. The opening price of the current K-line is higher than the closing price of the previous K-line.
4. The current K-line entity size is smaller than the previous K-line entity size.

When these conditions are met, it means that the market shows signs of a reversal of bull power, and it is time to enter the market long. Set stop loss and take profit to close the position after entering the market.

The advantage of this strategy is that it uses typical K-line patterns to identify reversal points, which is more intuitive. But there are also certain flaws:

1. The bullish siege pattern may not last, and there is a risk of being reversed.
2. K-line pattern recognition is difficult and requires parameter optimization.
3. Lagging signals and poor entry timing.
4. Backtest curve fitting is risky.

Generally speaking, the bullish encirclement and reversal strategy can be used as a reference for trend judgment, but caution is still required in the real market. The parameters should be appropriately loosened and used in conjunction with other indicators to verify the pattern. In addition, strict money management is also the key to successfully using this strategy.

This strategy identifies "bullish harami" candlestick patterns for bullish reversal trades. Specifically, long signals are generated when:

1. Current candle has a small body that is engulfed by the large previous bearish body.
2. Current candle body color is opposite of previous candle.
3. Current candle opens higher than previous candle's close.
4. Current candle body is smaller than previous candle's body.

When these conditions are met, it signifies bullish reversal momentum, at which point a long entry is taken. Stop loss and take profit exits are set after entry.

The advantage of this strategy is that it uses classical candlestick patterns to identify reversal points visually. However, some limitations exist:

1. Bullish harami may not sustain, risks being reversed.
2. Difficulty in accurately identifying candlestick patterns, requires optimization.
3. Lagging signals, poor entry timing.
4. Backtest curve fitting risk is high.

Overall, the bullish harami reversal strategy can serve as a reference for trend analysis, but should be applied cautiously in live trading. Parameters should be loosened and combined with other indicators for pattern verification. Also, strict risk management is key to successfully implementing this strategy.
