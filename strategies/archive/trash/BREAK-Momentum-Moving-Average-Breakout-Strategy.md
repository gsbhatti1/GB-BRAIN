## Strategy Principle

This strategy combines the BREAKOUT idea of the momentum indicator and the moving average, and trades when the momentum indicator changes direction continuously and the price breaks through the moving average.

Specific transaction logic:

1. Calculate short-term momentum, such as 5-day momentum

2. When the current momentum and the previous two momentum bars are both greater than 50, the long signal is established

3. When the price crosses the 5-day moving average, execute long position

4. When the current momentum and the previous two momentum bars are both less than 50, the short signal is established.

5. When the price falls below the 5-day moving average, execute short selling

6. Set fixed-point take-profit and trailing stop-loss strategies

This strategy gives full play to the trend judgment ability of the momentum indicator, and then combines it with the moving average breakthrough to form a high-probability trading signal to chase short-term price rises and falls.

## Strategic Advantages

- The continuous direction of momentum effectively determines the trend.

- Combined with moving average breakout to improve signal quality

- Combining take-profit and stop-loss strategies, with retracement control in place

## Strategy Risk

- Momentum continuation signals may lag

- Need to repeatedly test parameter optimization

- Take profit and stop loss settings need to be prudent

## Summary

This strategy organically combines the momentum indicator with the moving average BREAK system, sets reasonable stop-profit and stop-loss while ensuring signal quality, and can effectively capture short-term trend opportunities. But parameter setting and stop-loss strategy optimization are crucial.

## Strategy Logic

This strategy combines momentum indicators with moving average breakouts, entering trades when momentum aligns in a direction and price breaks the MA.

The trading logic is:

1. Compute short-term momentum, such as 5-day momentum

2. A long signal triggers when current and prior 2 momentum bars are above 50

3. Go long when price breaks above 5-day MA

4. A short signal triggers when current and prior 2 momentum bars are below 50

5. Go short when price breaks below 5-day MA

6. Use fixed profit target and trailing stop loss

The strategy capitalizes on momentum strength for trend identification, combining it with MA breakouts for high-probability signals to capture short-term price swings.

## Advantages

- Momentum directionality strongly defines trend

- MA breakout improves signal quality

- Profit target and stop loss combined

## Risks

- Consecutive momentum can lag

- Requires iterative parameter optimization

- Profit targets and stops need prudence

## Summary

This strategy synergizes momentum and MA breakout systems with prudent profit taking and risk controls. But parameter tuning and stop loss optimization are crucial for real-world effectiveness.
