## Strategy Principle

This strategy is designed to identify short- and medium-term swing opportunities using the 30-minute time frame. It comprehensively uses moving averages, RSI indicators, etc., to determine the market direction and entry timing.

Main transaction logic:

1. Calculate two weighted moving averages with different periods and compare their directions.
2. Calculate the RSI indicator to determine overbought and oversold conditions.
3. When the RSI indicator appears in the oversold area, consider taking shock trading opportunities at this point.
4. Combine the moving average direction to confirm the specific long and short direction.
5. Set a reasonable stop loss after entering the market to control risks.

This strategy attempts to seize short- and medium-term price reversal opportunities and achieve capital growth through frequent transactions under strict capital management.

## Strategic Advantages

- 30 minutes can identify shorter period oscillations
- RSI determines overbought and oversold with many reversal opportunities
- Weighted moving average smoothes prices

## Strategy Risk

- Requires frequent monitoring of market changes
- There is no certainty in reversals, and losses may occur
- High-frequency trading will increase transaction costs

## Summary

This strategy aims to explore short- and medium-term shock opportunities through a 30-minute cycle. However, the transaction frequency is high, so you need to pay attention to cost control and optimize strategy parameters to achieve sustained profits.
