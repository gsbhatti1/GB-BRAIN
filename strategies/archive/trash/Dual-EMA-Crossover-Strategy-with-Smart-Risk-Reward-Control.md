#### Overview
This is a trading strategy based on the crossover of 15-period and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The strategy implements intelligent stop-loss and take-profit levels to optimize risk-reward control. It not only captures trend reversal signals but also automatically adjusts trading parameters based on market volatility, thereby improving strategy stability and profitability.

#### Strategy Principle
The core logic is based on crossover signals between the fast EMA (15-period) and slow EMA (50-period). A long signal is generated when the fast line crosses above the slow line, and a short signal when the fast line crosses below. For risk management optimization, the strategy employs a dynamic stop-loss setting method, using the lowest opening price of the previous 2 candles as the long stop-loss and the highest opening price as the short stop-loss. The profit target is set at twice the risk, ensuring a favorable risk-reward ratio. The strategy uses 30% of the account equity for trading, which helps control risk exposure.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Dynamic Risk Management: The strategy automatically adjusts risk parameters based on market volatility through real-time stop-loss calculations.
2. Optimized Risk-Reward Ratio: Setting profit targets at twice the stop-loss distance ensures reasonable profit potential for each trade.
3. Robust Money Management: Using 30% of account equity for trading maintains a balance between profit potential and risk control.
4. Bi-directional Trading Opportunities: The strategy captures both long and short trading opportunities, increasing trading frequency and profit potential.
5. Visual Assistance: Stop-loss and take-profit levels are marked on the chart, allowing traders to monitor trade status intuitively.

#### Strategy Risks
1. Choppy Market Risk: During sideways markets, EMA crossover signals may generate false signals leading to consecutive losses.
2. Slippage Risk: During rapid market movements, actual execution prices may significantly deviate from intended prices.
3. Money Management Risk: Using a fixed 30% of equity might be too aggressive under certain market conditions.
4. Stop-Loss Setting Risk: Stop-losses based on the previous 2 candles might not be flexible enough in extreme market conditions.

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Implement Trend Filters: Add additional trend confirmation indicators like ADX or trend strength indicators to filter weak signals.
2. Dynamic Position Sizing: Automatically adjust position size based on market volatility for better adaptability.
3. Optimize Stop-Loss Method: Consider incorporating ATR indicator for stop-loss settings to better reflect market volatility characteristics.
4. Add Time Filters: Implement trading time filters to avoid periods of high volatility or low liquidity.
5. Include Volume Confirmation: Use volume as a confirmation indicator to improve signal reliability.

#### Summary
This is a well-structured EMA crossover strategy with clear logic. By combining classical technical analysis methods with modern risk management techniques, the strategy achieves favorable risk-reward characteristics. While there is room for optimization, the basic framework demonstrates good practicality and extensibility. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy's performance can be further enhanced.
