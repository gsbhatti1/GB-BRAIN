Strategy Description

Sling Shot System + Even Better System.

I received an email about a Trend Following System that sells for $1000, but I could get it for only $500 on that day!!!

In the video showing this Amazing System, which may have taken me just one minute to code, I coded it up. And hey…It's not a bad system. It’s good for people who need an Entry Signal to get them into a Trending Move and KEEP them in a Trending Move while providing a defined Stop.

So I thought I would save the community the Fair price of Only $500 for a system that consists of a couple of EMA’s and a few Rules…And give it to you for free.

See Link Below for Main Chart Showing 2nd System!!!
