// This is combo strategies for get a cumulative signal. 
//
// First strategy
// This System was created from the Book "How I Tripled My Money In The 
// Futures Market" by Ulf Jensen, Page 183. This is reverse type of strategies.
// The strategy buys at market, if close price is higher than the previous close 
// during 2 days and the meaning of 9-days Stochastic Slow Oscillator is lower than 50. 
// The strategy sells at market, if close price is lower than the previous close price 
// during 2 days and the meaning of 9-days Stochastic Fast Oscillator is higher than 50.
//
// Second strategy
// The FVE is a pure volume indicator. Unlike most of the other indicators 
// (except OBV), price change doesn't come into the equation for the FVE (price 
// is not multiplied by volume), but is only used to determine whether money is 
// flowing in or out of the stock. This is contrary to the current trend in the 
// design of modern money flow indicators. The author decided against a price-volume 
// indicator for the following reasons:
// - A pure volume indicator has more power to contradict.
// - The number of buyers or sellers (which is assessed by volume) will be the same, 
//     regardless of the price fluctuation.
// - Price-volume indicators tend to spike excessively at breakouts or breakdowns.
//
// WARNING:
// - For purpose educate only
// - This script to change bars colors.
