## Strategy Principle

This strategy is designed to identify short- and medium-term swing opportunities using the 30-minute time frame. It comprehensively uses moving averages, RSI indicators, etc., to determine the market direction and entry timing.

Main transaction logic:

1. Calculate two weighted moving averages with different periods and compare their directions.
2. Calculate RSI indicator to determine overbought and oversold conditions.
3. When the RSI indicator appears in the oversold area, consider shock trading opportunities at this point.
4. Combine the moving average direction to confirm the specific long and short direction.
5. Set a reasonable stop loss after entering the market to control risks.

This strategy attempts to seize short- and medium-term price reversal opportunities and achieve capital growth through frequent transactions under strict capital management.

## Strategic Advantages

- 30 minutes can identify shorter period oscillations.
- RSI determines overbought and oversold conditions with many reversal opportunities.
- Weighted moving average smooths prices.

## Strategy Risk

- Requires frequent monitoring of market changes.
- There is no certainty in reversals, and losses may occur.
- High-frequency trading will increase transaction costs.

## Summary

This strategy attempts to explore short- and medium-term shock opportunities through a 30-minute cycle. However, the transaction frequency is high, so you need to pay attention to cost control and optimize strategy parameters to achieve sustained profits.

## Strategy Logic

This strategy aims to identify medium-term swing trades using the 30-minute timeframe. It combines moving averages, RSI, and more to gauge direction and entry timing.

The key trading logic:

1. Compute two weighted moving averages of differing periods and compare their slope.
2. Use RSI indicator to identify overbought/oversold levels.
3. Consider swing trade opportunities at extreme RSI levels.
4. Confirm long/short direction using moving average slope.
5. Enter trades with reasonable stop loss for risk control.

The strategy seeks to capture reversal opportunities in the medium-term, growing capital through frequent trading and strict risk management.

## Advantages

- 30-minute timeframe identifies shorter-term swings.
- RSI signals many reversal chances at extremes.
- Weighted moving averages smooth prices.

## Risks

- Requires constant market monitoring.
- Reversals not guaranteed, losses possible.
- High frequency trading increases costs.

## Summary

This strategy aims to uncover medium-term swing trades using 30-minute patterns. But higher trade frequency necessitates cost controls and parameter optimization for sustained profitability.
