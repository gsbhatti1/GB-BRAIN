#### Overview
This strategy identifies and trades significant price movements based on candlestick size. It achieves precise control through specific tick thresholds, trading time windows, and daily trade frequency limits. The strategy is specifically optimized for the futures market and can capture significant price movements during high liquidity periods.

#### Strategy Principle
The core logic of the strategy is to calculate the high-low range of each candlestick (in ticks) and compare it with a preset threshold. When the candlestick size exceeds the threshold within the specified trading window (default 7:00-9:15 CST), the system triggers long or short trading signals based on the candlestick direction. To control risk, the strategy limits execution to one trade per day and sets take-profit and stop-loss levels.

#### Strategy Advantages
1. Precise Tick Control - Ensures trading execution accuracy through tick-level calculations
2. Time Filtering - Focuses on trading during periods of highest market activity
3. Risk Management - Sets clear take-profit and stop-loss levels to protect capital
4. Trade Frequency Control - Daily trade limit prevents overtrading
5. Visual Alerts - Triggered candlesticks are highlighted for easy analysis
6. Backtesting Compatibility - Includes date filtering and time execution features for historical testing

#### Strategy Risks
1. Market Volatility Risk - May trigger false signals during periods of extreme volatility
2. Slippage Risk - High-speed trading in futures markets may lead to execution price deviation
3. Opportunity Cost - Daily trade limit may miss other good trading opportunities
4. Time Dependency - Strategy effectiveness highly depends on chosen trading window

#### Strategy Optimization Directions
1. Dynamic Threshold - Automatically adjust candlestick size threshold based on market volatility
2. Multiple Timeframes - Add confirmation signals from multiple timeframes
3. Volume Filter - Incorporate volume indicators as auxiliary judgment
4. Market Sentiment Indicators - Integrate volatility indicators to assess market conditions
5. Adaptive Take-Profit/Stop-Loss - Set dynamic exit levels based on market volatility

#### Summary
This strategy provides a reliable trading system for futures through precise tick control and strict time filtering. Its strengths lie in execution accuracy and risk control, but traders need to optimize parameters based on specific instruments and market conditions. Through the suggested optimization directions, the strategy can further enhance its adaptability and stability.
